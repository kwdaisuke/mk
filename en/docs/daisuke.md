After finishing my undergraduate degree in Area Studies where I specialize in Big Data in Africa, I continue to study MSc of Data Science in Data ScienceTech Institute and graduate in the first class with an honor.

During my undergraduate I also worked for Amazon's startup project(Amazon Explorer) in Tokyo as beta team to test out the product and contribute to sorting out potential edge cases.

During my master,  I have worked for Japanese startup as Data Scientist to convey PoC project where I clean/prepare/model/validate/test data and as Compute Vision Engineer to deploy deepsort(Object Tracking) into the edge device(NVIDIA Jetson) by converting the configuration file used for the core algorithm with the open-source memory-less framework.

Currently working as cloud support engineer in Data Shard at EPAM Systems where handling the BigData/DataScience/MachineLearning/AI inquiries(those minors to the criticals) from the enterprises including those from Fortune 500 and FAANG by analyzing logs, metrics, source code and reproducing an infrastructure with the ticket system with the corresponding SLA/SLO.

Born in Japan, traveling around the world since 16 years old, especially several years in France where I stay in the south France city called [Montpellier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb1eNSH4EGQ&ab_channel=DaisukeKuwabara). My imagination is from the inspiration in every moment I live, feel, experience materliazed into the creative entity.
